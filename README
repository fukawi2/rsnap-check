This is a fork of the script created by Till Elsner (till.elsner@henkel.com) to
monitor rsnapshot backups. I found various issues with the original script so
am forking it to fix these issues.

Main issues found with original script:
   * Script will report error state until EVERY backup interval has been
     completed. This could take over a year depending how many weekly or
	 monthly intervals you keep.
   * If a complete backup is missing (eg, hourly.5/host.example.com/) the
     script reports an error for EVERY expected backup location under this
	 parent path. Makes for a lot of unnecessary noise.
   * Recursive parsing of "include_conf" was borked.
